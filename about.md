## About
<p> Hi. I am Erick Oduniyi. I'm an undergraduate researcher at the University of Kansas studying computer engineering and mathematics. In general, I'm interested in storytelling, design (tools: language, computing systems, institutions), and how design shapes our cognitive processes. Here, I will be blogging about a particular project that is being supported by a Collaborative Research Experiences for Undergraduates (CREU) grant. The goal is to give an overview of the work we will be doing on modeling language learning. </p>
