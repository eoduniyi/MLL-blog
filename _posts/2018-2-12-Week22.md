# Group meeting
We could not make the CogSci 2018 deadline, so we spent this week talking about alternative conference venus. Additionally, we outlined some experiments we would like to try with the corpora. These are LTASS experiments that will hopefully allow us to see the acoustic structure of the two CHILDES corpus and the VoxForge Corpus. The SNR experiments we conducted were good, but other acoustic properties might be better descriptions of the difference between the two.

## LTASS
The Long-Term Average Speech Spectrum (LTASS) is a representation of where sounds are regarding pitch and volume, superimposed over the result of a hearing test. Hence, we want to use the LTASS method to observe which parts of spectrum fall within their "hearing range" of the two corpora. Hopefully they similar, if they are not, the results are still illuminating.

## Kaldi
Working on changing the way some of the VoxForge scripts work to generate results from the CHILDES data. The CHILDES data might need to be reformatted, but at the moment we are trying to use a pearl regexp to accounts for both the folder and files of the CHILDEs data.
