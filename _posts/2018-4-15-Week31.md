# Working on [through] something still

This week I read Teleological and referential understanding of action in infancy (Csibra, G. 2003).

# Notes
In this paper, Csibra notes how [goal-directed attribution](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22464099) and having a self-referring bias are the bases for discerning human and non-human movement. These are formally described as the teleological and referential frameworks. In order to support such theories about action discernment, the author presents various goal attribution studies as well as the author's research, which looks at how an infant’s looking-time varies with the interpretation of efficiency in shapes and objects.
The results of this study ultimately become the elements of Csibra’s <b>teleological stance</b>. The <b>referential stance</b> also solidifies with the presentation of looking-time experiments and conjectures about an infant’s referential system is most likely a bootstrap for language acquisition. In short, I really liked this paper as they outline the underlying cognitive performances infant’s employ to learn about their world.

Next week I start putting together my powerpoint slides.
