# Group meeting
We could not make the CogSci 2018 deadline, so we spent this week talking about alternative conference venus. Additionally, we outlined some experiments we would like to try with the corpora. These are LTASS experiments that will hopefully allow us to see the acoustic structure of the two CHILDES corpus and the VoxForge Corpus. The SNR experiments we conducted were good, but other acoustic properties might be better descriptions of the difference between the two.

Best, <br />
