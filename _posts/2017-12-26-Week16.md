This week I will be Working on CogSci paper. I've attached the overleaf [link](https://www.overleaf.com/12902967bjkgvwnqdkfs#/49333807/) here.
As a group we decided that we could write the entire paper independent of the results. So we outline a specific hypothesis and a potential result we would generate. Then, we complete are results and analysis we can go back and either confirm or deny our hypothesis.
