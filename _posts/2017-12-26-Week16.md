This week I will be working on my CogSci paper. I've attached the overleaf link [here](https://www.overleaf.com/12902967bjkgvwnqdkfs#/49333807/).
As a group we decided that we could write the entire paper independent of the results. So we outlined a specific hypothesis and potential results that we would generate. Then, we complete are results and analysis we can go back and either confirm or deny our hypothesis.
