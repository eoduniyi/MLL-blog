# Notes on Processing
I initially wanted to learn about the [<b>Processing</b>](https://processing.org/) programming language because it was advertised as a "programming language for visual artist". Art is cool, sometimes I feel like an artist. I actually first learned about Processing from one of the researchers at the [<b>Santa Fe Institute</b>](https://www.santafe.edu/) who was working on robotics and modeling morphological computation. I think he was trying to use Processing for some pretty interesting human-computer interaction projects.

I think Processing could be super cool for visualizing some of my research results. For example, I would like to visualize conversations between parents and their children, or the noise in the environment during parent-child interactions. You can actually view such interactions via CHILDES [Browsable Database](https://childes.talkbank.org/browser/index.php?url=Eng-NA/Rollins/).

## ≡ lines
Okay, okay, so for a quick exercise I wanted to draw three lines of varying width. These three lines are sensitive (frequency and amplitude dependent) to whatever input signal (song, conversation, noise in environment). It should look like strips of paper flowing in space or maybe chunky <i>waves</i>:

I really do hope to utilize some animation in my future research presentations. I think they can help people (including myself) have fun and understand the work better. Further, optical illusions and psychoacoustics
 (see [Vestibulo–ocular reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibulo%E2%80%93ocular_reflex) & [auditory illusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_illusion)) would be cool to study more.
