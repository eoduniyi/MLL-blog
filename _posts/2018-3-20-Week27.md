# Spring Break
This week was spring break, so I'm going to try working on side projects. I have a couple of embedded system projects that I want to try I'm really interested in embedded system. There are a lot of very powerful and portable computing systems than can run any basic operating systems. For example, the Raspberry Pi model B has the form factor of a credit card (3.370 in Ã— 2.224 in), includes various I/O ports (usb, ethernet, hdmi etc.), and is very cheap. I have a couple and I want to try setting up [pocketSphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx) on a raspberry pi. <i>pocketSphinx</i> is a
portable speech recognition software made for handheld and mobile devices.
