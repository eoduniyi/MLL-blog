# Formatting audio data for Kaldi
This week I came back to Kaldi and began to format the audio data. This is the final process in getting our ASR to generate meaningful (or not meaningful) results. From the various tutorials I have read, there is still a lot of scripting involved. I think I wanted to use MATLAB for this opposed to creating a bash script.
