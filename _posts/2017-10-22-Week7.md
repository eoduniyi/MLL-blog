Quick recap: I'm learning to build an simple ASR system with Kaldi using VoxForge data as Kaldi has a couple of pre-built recipes available. This week I will try building and installing different language modeling toolkits.

## Building language models
One of the language model toolkits I'm interested in is the [MIT Language Modeling Toolkit](https://github.com/mitlm/mitlm) (MITLMT), I think there are a lot of useful features I want to learn. Though before I explore MITLMT, the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (SRILM) is already packaged with Kakdi and works with the VoxForge data, so I will actually go through the installation process of SRILM first. 

### Notes about SRILM
[SRILM](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html) is a toolkit for building and applying statistical language models (LMs), primarily for use in speech recognition, statistical tagging and segmentation, and machine translation. I'm not too familiar with N-gram language modeling, but this is the main type of language model that SRI supports.

```
$ local/voxforge_prepare_lm.sh
=== Building a language model ...

You appear to not have SRILM tools installed, either on your path,
or installed in /Users/erickoduniyi/kaldi-trunk/egs/voxforge/s5/../../../tools/srilm/bin/i686-m64. See tools/install_srilm.sh for installation
instructions.
```
I actually need to run <i>run.sh</i>:
```
$ run.sh
=== Starting VoxForge subset selection(accent: ((American)|(British)|(Australia)|(Zealand))) ...

*** VoxForge subset selection finished!

--- Mapping the "anonymous" speakers to unique IDs ...

Illegal or empty gender (p) for "anonymous0354-20091027-coy" - assuming m(ale) .

```
Again, this has to deal with the nature of the Voxforge data... I can't tell if this is going to be problem...

```
*** Initial VoxForge data preparation finished!
=== Building a language model ...
--- Preparing a corpus from test and train transcripts ...
You appear to not have SRILM tools installed, either on your path,
or installed in /Users/erickoduniyi/kaldi-trunk/egs/voxforge/s5/../../../tools/srilm/bin/i686-m64. See tools/install_srilm.sh for installation
instructions.
```
Again, I actually still need to install SRILM before I can actually run <i>voxforge_prepare_lm.sh</i> :

```
$ tools/install_srilm.sh
This script cannot install SRILM in a completely automatic
way because you need to put your address in a download form.
Please download SRILM from http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html
```

There were a set of steps that I needed to follow for installing SRILM, and the things that depend on SRILM (and a lot of other language modeling toolkits). This process actually took a lot longer than expected....

```
$ local/voxforge_prepare_lm.sh
=== Building a language model ...
--- Preparing a corpus from test and train transcripts ...
*** Finished building the LM model!
```
Okay, once that was finished This is a good place to stop, I will go back and try and install the MITLM, but using the SRILM should be fine.

Best, <br />
