# Group meeting
We had another group meeting to catch up on some last minute details and go over our CogSci outlines. We were still unclear about how much usable data from the CHILDES corpus we have, so we talked about different ways to extract all the transcripts/audio files that had the appropriate timestamps and parent tags. Again, not all transcripts have parent tags (MOT, FAT, MOM, etc. these are how guardians are denoted in the transcript), which means we can't extract child-directed speech from those transcripts. Further, not all transcripts have timestamps.

So, for our data, we are interested in the subset of transcripts that have timestamps and parent tags:

Best, <br />
