### Group meeting
For week 7 we had our 5th group meeting and talked about the different interesting directions our project could develop into. These sorts of conversations are usually difficult, but fun.

Me and Rebekah also had weekly meeting. We actually haven't had one of these in a couple of weeks. I think we forget that keep in touch with each other is not only useful for updating the blogs, but also sitting down and talking about the project. In a way, it's two people trying to converge on a set of questions and methods for answering them. Sure, we have separate portions of the project, but some of the more interesting things can only be observed when our two projects are together.

Again, one of our main goals is to submit to the CogSci conference in February detailing a new framework that combines (and explains why it's important to combine) the speech processing and network analysis perspective to better understand early language acquisition. I think the combination of speech processing and network analysis stand as a concrete metaphor for a holistic view of acquisition.
