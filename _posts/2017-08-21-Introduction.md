This is an introduction to the CREU research blog/jorunal I will be starting this academic year. The research project, as you may have guessed it, deals with modeling language learning. But really, how do children learn language? Hopefully the work we do this semester and beyond will help us get closer to understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms of early child language acquisition.

Feel free to contact me (erickoduniyi@ku.edu) especially if you're interested in speech processing, storytelling, and design.

Best,
EO
