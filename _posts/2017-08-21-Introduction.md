Hi, welcome to the research blog I will be starting this academic year. The research project, as you may have guessed it, deals with modeling language learning. How do children learn language? Are there certain teaching strategies or types of speech that support successful language acquisition? Well, hopefully the work we do this semester and beyond will help us get closer to understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms behind early child language acquisition.

Feel free to contact me (erickoduniyi@ku.edu) especially if you're interested in speech processing, storytelling, and design.

Best,
EO
