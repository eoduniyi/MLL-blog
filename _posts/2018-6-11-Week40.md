<!-- ### Voice activity detection
It should be noted that the CHILDES audio segments I generated and used for the above acoustic analysis are lacking in comparability. As I mentioned previously, the time stamps I used to extract the audio segments don't always correspond to speech utterances. To be clear, while the transcribers worked to encode the actual words uttered, the recordings of the actual words are sometimes unclear, noisy, and contain unnecessary silence. This silence, and general noise could have <i>some</i> effect on the LTASS results and will surely effect the recognition results of the ASR system. Hence, there needs to be a way to extract meaningful speech from the audio segments before using it to train the ASR. People typically perform this task using Voice activity detection (VAD) and in truth, I should have applied VAD before segmenting the audio files from the transcripts. -->
