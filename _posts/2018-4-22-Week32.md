# Presentation notes pt.1
The 2018 KU symposium is in two weeks, so I decided to start outlining my presentation. I only have 10 minutes, so again the goal is make the research as simple and as profound as possible. You know, high-level messaging through simple clean digestible powerpoint slides.

At the moment, I've taken my concept slides and speech slides and melded them together to give myself a nice outline. I actually presented these slides to Dr. Brumberg and Rebekah, because they've already seen most of this, we mostly talked about what I should and shouldn't present. For example, avoid talking about how artificial intelligence is and will continue to manage a weird amount of human life...

The Amazon Echo (Alexa) is a great example of modern speech recognition systems. They help us make reservations and schedule events within our lives.

These speech recognition systems are pretty robust and typically human-to-computer speech recognition is pretty accurate. That is, most of the time Alexa recognizes our speech.

Within speech recognition system is the decoder. The decoder is doing the heavy lifting.

On further inspection, the task of the decoder is to find the string of words that maximizes the likelihood of generating the observation (input signal | audio wave).

Perhaps children also have a statistical model of speech.

Now, we want to highlight the language representation that humans use when decoding (perceiving) speech. We use networks to represent language (complex system).


![slide7](https://storage.googleapis.com/root-proposal-1246/CREU_DATA/week_32/Slide7.png)

This allows us to highlight how the adult's language network is much larger than a child's. The interpretation here is that the child knows less words and the connections between these words aren't as redundant or efficient for navigating.

High-level messaging :)

Okay, so we swap the typical child for Alexa and see how an automatic speech recognition system will learn given a ton of child-directed speech.


Best, <br />
