Hey,

This is an introduction to the researhc blog/jorunal I will be starting this academic semester. The reseach project, as you may have guessed it, is about modeling language learning. Really interesting question, how do children learn language? Well, hopefully the work we do this semester and beyond will help us get closer to understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms of early child language aquistion. 

Best,
EO
